- This repository will include some Power BI projects and my progress with the tool. From my first dashboard in 2021 to the latest ones. I will also publish my 2024 project to better showcase the evolution achieved.

# Project 1: 2024 - Midia Overview


- In this project, the focus was to evaluate media for a client (Ambev - fictitious data). The objective was to break down this analysis by the main aspects, brands, and regions (with a gallery that helps to better understand which media is being used) to provide an overview of their distributions, understanding strengths and weaknesses, as well as key brands and regions.

# Project 1: 2021

 Contribution Margin Analysis

- First Page: Aims to show what has been executed.
- Second Page: Seeks to demonstrate how each variable in the calculation will influence future results based on current outcomes.
- Third Page: Provides a statistical summary of margins, with the goal of capturing "outliers" and the data distribution.

# Project 2: 2022

- First Page: Aims to present the Sell-Out of Retailers over the weeks, analyzing an overview of sales, inventory, and cumulative sales, along with their variations over time. It also includes trend analysis, top clients, and a stock-to-sales ratio metric, which is crucial for inventory evaluation and trend assessment.

- Second Page: Tells a different story, focusing on presenting more detailed data broken down by larger granularities and providing the option to export data.

- First Chart: Shows the comparison between reached and not reached customers.
- Second Chart: Compares reached vs. not reached customers by salesperson.
- Tables:
   - Quantity, Sales, Share (net sales/total), Goal, % Achieved Goal (percentage of goal achieved), CTF, and Classification A and BC broken down by product line, product group, salesperson, and customer.
   - Last Table: Provides a description by SKU level, including quarterly average sold quantity, M0, M1, M2, and M3 of sold quantity, growth variation, and ABC Classification.
