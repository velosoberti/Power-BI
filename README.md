# Project 1: 2024 - Digital Analytics - Meta - Unibanco (fake data)

- 
The goal of this project is to evaluate data from Meta Facebook campaigns and ads. The analysis begins with more summary views such as Reach, Impressions, and Average CTR/CPM, as well as the distribution of impressions by age and gender and an evolution over time. The idea of the first part is to provide an overview of the campaigns/ads' capabilities, identifying the strongest audience and whether the investments are on the right track.

In the second part, we detail engagement metrics such as likes, shares, conversions, etc. Here, the level of detail provides a more focused view on describing how each campaign captures attention, to understand if the thumbnail attracts or if the content generates conversions.

# Project 2: 2024 - Midia Overview (fake data)


- In this project, the focus was to evaluate media for a client. The objective was to break down this analysis by the main aspects, brands, and regions (with a gallery that helps to better understand which media is being used) to provide an overview of their distributions, understanding strengths and weaknesses, as well as key brands and regions.

It also includes trend analysis, top clients, and a stock-to-sales ratio metric, which is crucial for inventory evaluation and trend assessment.
